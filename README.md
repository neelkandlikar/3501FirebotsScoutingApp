**3501 Firebots Scouting App**

Android application used by our FRC Robotics team to record data on other teams and matches at regional competitions. There are two parts to the app: QR code generation and QR code scanning.

Each scout on our team used a tablet with the app downloaded on it to record data points such as points scored, penalties, etc. Once a match was complete, all of the recorded data would be encapsulated in a single QR code generated by the application

The QR code method was implemented as a means to deal with the lack of WiFi availability at competitions. One person would have the application downloaded on their personal mobile phone and use the scanner part of the application to scan the generated QR codes following each match. Upon scanning the codes, the data contained within the QR code would be sent to Firebase.

From there, a Google Apps Script would run a few times an hour to query the database and export the data into an easily readable Google Sheet for analysis and team strategy development.
